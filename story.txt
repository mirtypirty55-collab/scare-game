first the player wakes up in his he slowly opens his eyes and gets out of the bed he notices a photo frame without a photo nothing comes to mind he dosent remember having a family or anything similar (he is a orphan) he walk around for a bit in his room looking at furniture and the calendar with the day 26 marked with a x that the exile day that happens once every month it exiles a villager to save food rations they barely have enough to feed every mouth in the village they dont have a choice,a villager is selected by votes from every villager there are elders that handle the village and votes they decide everything in the village,today is the 25 tomorrow is the exile day, today you go scavenging for food in the ravine with plants and such its close to the village but villagers rarely approach it from fear of pokemons, as you arrive there you see a few pokemon pass and stop for a brief moment to take a look at you they continue after that they to the river to drink water you watch them drink then leave you continue scavenging for food after that you only find a few berries by the end of they day,you return home and go to sleep.

**Q&A after Part 1:**
- **The Village:** its a small village about 5 houses
- **Exile Day:** its just humans pokemon dont live in the village they cant afford that
- **The Player:** hes just a unlucky child abandoned or maybe hes also lucky but bring unluck to everyone else?
- **The Ravine:** mostly wary there isnt any dangerous pokemon for now
- **Tone:** its a dark fantasy berserk inspired game

**Part 2:**
you wake up today id the exile day its 6am you get out of bed the sun hasnt come up yet not that its ever visible the weather is always gloomy and bad, you step out you see the villagers and the elders assembled in the middle of the village,it seems like a eldery man has been chosen,one of the elder speaks up "Villagers... today as you know it is the exile day we have gathered the votes of everyone and today Dorian the old men has been chosen NOW DORIAN I AM NOT DESOLATED FROM PITY SO I WILL GRANT YOU TWO OPTIONS... WILL YOU TAKE THE ROAD TO THE FOREST TO MAYBE SURVIVE A COUPLE MORE DAYS OR WILL YOU GO IN THE VILLAGE CAVE THAT WILL OFFER YOU A QUICK END? NOW I SHALL GIVE YOU A MOMENT TO PONDER THOSE THOUGHTS".

**Part 3:**
dorian"i... i i will choose thy cave i hath already suffered greatly all my life a little more wont shake me..." Elder"GREAT.... WE SHALL NOT WAIT A MOMENT LONGER NOW GO !" Dorian heads for the cave he dosent give a single look back but he is getting slower and slower as he approaches the cave he waits for a moment longer then heads in. pokemon screams can be heard they quickly stopped after a moment,its been a few hours he hasnt come out. he is dead.

**Q&A after Part 3:**
- **Player's Perspective:** its normal for everyone they have seen it one too many times they dont question it anymore
- **Dorian's Choice:** you will get the answer in the third part
- **The Cave & Forest:** both of them have dangerous pokemon but the cave is guaranteed death
- **Player's Future:** you are spot on

**Part 4:**
the elders light candles around the village for light and as a homage to the dead,(Might this be a way to protect the village from pokemons ? is it linked to the exile?), you are at home resting in your bed and remembering tales of the village cave they say that the pokemon inside are veterans (strongest normal pokemon in this game apart from legendaries) they say that no one has ever come out safe only a few have survived but died shortly after they got out they say that they were in pieces,the cave rumours say that the pokemon inside are guardians that protect something in the cave what might that be ? you slowly fall asleep as you remember that dark tale

**Q&A after Part 4:**
- **Cave Guardians:** they are normal veteran pokemon ( vetrans are pokemon that have lived for a long time and have developed incredible skills) this ones probably had trainers in the past
- **The "Something" Inside:** its a egg
- **Candles & Protection:** dont know yet i just wanted to add a sense of mystery since there wasnt enough

**Part 5:**
almost a month has passed nothing happened of great interest,there have been some rumors of you but you dont know what they are about the exile day is in 2 days,one day later,you wake up from a nightmare you dont think much of it you just point out that it hasnt happened in a long time,another day passes,today is the day,you hear loud bangs on your door you hurry to see who it is, its the Elders.

**Part 6:**
THE ELDERS HAVE A TERRIFYING EXPRESSION YOU'VE HAVE NEVER FELT THIS TYPE OF FEAR BEFORE YOUR INSTINCTS TELL YOU TO RUN BUT YOU ARE FROZEN IN PLACE, The Elders do not say any words for a moment too long,one of the elders relaxes his face after a while he starts speaking,Elder1 "Child it seems that today you might be chosen why dont you come with us in the middle and wait for the rest to wake up." YOU HAVE NO WORDS COMING YOU MOVE OUT OF INSTINCTS FOR YOU'RE LIFE YOU FOLLOW THEM TO THE MIDDLE OF THE VILLAGE

**Note:** i want you to understand that the elders had probably the most terrifying faces that humans can make

**Part 7:**
YOU FOLLOW THE ELDERS TO THE MIDDLE OF THE VILLAGE they seem to have gone back to normal you're hear is still pounding but you seem to be able to move again its still night outside it seems that you will have to wait for a while for other villagers to wake up A FEW OF THE ELDERS LEAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER HOUSE YOU ARE LEFT WITH ONE OF THE ELDERS HE SEEMS NORMAL TOO NORMAL NOTHING HAPPENS THE OTHER ELDERS HAVE COME BACK WITH SOMEONE ELSE HE SEEMS TO BE MISSING A FINGER

**Q&A after Part 7:**
- **Missing Finger:** he got hes finger cut because he didnt cooperate fast enough with the elders the player instincts were right
- **Player's Understanding:** the player understands the hasnt a word in any of this
- **Potential Exiles:** Him and the other villager that came with the elders are potential exiles

the villagers act like they are possessed it feels like you are thorn apart from all the puling pushing punches bites they..... massacre you they throw you inside the cave you are uncuncious half dead

**Note:** the village wont be a main map its just mainly a story setter and a tutorial

**Part 10.2:**
you seem to open you're eyes for a moment one of you're eyes hurts too much and one of your leg is clearly broken,(his eyes has been pulled out.) you fall back into a unconscious state,you dont know how much time passed but you seem to wake up,you start crawling mindlessly trying to survive on you're last thread of life.

**Part 10.3:**
you crawl without a single thought in you're head its all survival you seem to be touching something.... its a decomposed leg.

**Part 10.4:**
you cannot see clearly its too dark and you're vision is damaged it looks like the garments of dorian.

**Part 10.5:**
you close you're eye you are too exhausted you fall again into unconsciousness , after a long time a trembling sound seems to wake you up,you open you're eye you see a pulsing weak glow coming from dorian hand.what might it be ?

**Part 11:**
you realise that its a pokeball

you have two option take the pokeball or die miserably

you choose to take the pokeball you somehow manage to rest alongside dorian corpse on the wall,you hold the pokeball in you're arms its a bit warm,you hold it for a while but it seems like its getting colder with time,player"this must be the 100 year limit of pokeballs.) you accidentally release the pokeball and it falls it seems to start shaking.what might that mean ? find that out in the next chapter

**Part 12:**
the pokeball shakes violently it seems to want to lift of the ground but fails.a paw seems to be holding the pokeball open it seems like its coming from the pokeball? the paw is almost bigger than the pokeball.this creature seems to slowly creep out of it what is it gonna be ?

**Explanation:** small explanation the pokeball died the pokemon somehow noticed that and saved itself from being eternally closed in the pokeball and dying by holding the pokeball open with its paw next chapter coming soon

the paw slowly prying the pokeball open and another paw comes out, the creature is slowly coming out it seems to be struggling, a ear is also coming out now, the pokeball studently explode open from all the force from the pokemon.what is this creature the player cant seem to see what it could be,the player suddenly faints.
