1. Veteran System

Replaces XP/leveling systems completely.

Calculates strength based on:

Moves used

Battles won or lost

Limb loss

Vision loss

Scars

Attacks endured

Trauma (psychological/physical)

Pokémon can become stronger or weaker based on how they fight: losing isn’t automatically bad—if they fight their best, they can gain strength.

Retreating doesn’t count as a loss; you can fight well and retreat to avoid injuries.

Old logs decay or weaken over time to avoid punishing the player for one loss, but permanent injuries remain.

No HP bar or stats; all progression is shown through descriptive text:

Example: “This Pokémon is battle-hardened, sharp, fast, and strong. It is missing a limb, but is still effective.”

Example: “This Pokémon is not in good shape; missing two limbs and half blind. It seems to have past trauma and can’t fight effectively anymore.”

System creates logs for every Pokémon to track everything they’ve done.

The world continues in the background while the player progresses:

Wild Pokémon fight each other and grow stronger or weaker.

Trainers fight in the background, becoming great or vanishing if they lose all their Pokémon.

Encountering the same Pokémon at different times may mean it is tens of times stronger or weaker.

Pokémon live up to 100 years; older Pokémon are experienced but not necessarily in good condition—they can be strong or weak.

Losing a limb is traumatic and reduces stats significantly, but minor losses like a claw barely affect stats.

Adaptation to injuries is gradual, not instant.

Losing well can increase strength, but only if fighting strong enemies; it doesn’t work against weak ones.

The system is designed to be realistic, descriptive, and dynamic, adding infinite replayability and meaningful consequences.

2. Struggler Quirk

Rare quirk (1 in a million), can be from birth or gained through extreme trauma (e.g., losing an entire party but barely surviving).

Effects:

Extreme hardiness; fights through hits and injuries

Can adapt movesets to accommodate injuries or prosthetics

Prosthetics give defensive boosts for those with the quirk

Cannot restore lost stats fully but mitigates damage

Legendary Pokémon cannot have the quirk—they have never experienced trauma or needed it.

Even Pokémon without the Struggler quirk adapt their movesets to injuries, just not as effectively.

3. Injuries, Trauma, & Adaptation

Limb loss, vision loss, permanent scars, and other trauma affect stats and effectiveness.

Pokémon adapt to injuries gradually, changing their fighting style and movesets over time.

Blind Pokémon sharpen their other senses but require a skilled trainer, otherwise they are ineffective.

Losing a limb drastically reduces performance; minor parts lost (like claws) have little effect.

Adaptation works for all Pokémon but takes time and experience.

Permanent injuries cannot be undone and remain part of the Pokémon’s history.

4. Combat Mechanics

Winning battles increases strength; losing battles can also increase strength if fought effectively.

Retreating allows survival without major penalties but gives less progression.

Fighting poorly or against weak enemies does not improve stats significantly.

Risk is inherent: fighting strong opponents may result in permanent injuries, even if successful.

There is no cheating via easy farming—the system detects the quality of fights.

5. Background Simulation

The game world continues in the background while the player progresses.

Wild Pokémon and trainers fight independently.

Pokémon may gain strength, lose strength, or even die without player interaction.

This creates a dynamic, living world where encounters can be drastically different between visits.

6. Lifespan & Pokéball Mechanics

Pokémon have a maximum lifespan of 100 years.

Near-100-year Pokémon are highly experienced but may be physically weak.

Pokéballs only last 100 years: after this limit, the Pokémon inside dies unless it escapes.

Mechanics tie directly into story events (e.g., the cave Pokémon saving itself from a dead Pokéball).

7. Summary of System Effects

The Veteran System removes primitive XP mechanics and replaces them with a fully dynamic, descriptive system.

Struggler Quirk creates rare, adaptive Pokémon that can survive extreme conditions.

Injuries, trauma, and adaptation create long-term consequences for decisions.

Background world simulation ensures infinite replayability and emergent storytelling.

Combat requires strategy and risk assessment; every action matters.

Lifespan and Pokéball mechanics tie survival, rarity, and story into gameplay.
